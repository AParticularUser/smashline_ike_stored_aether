--------------------------Stored Eather--------------------------------

The source code for my Stored Eather mod for SSBU, written in Rust-Smashline.
This mod was insppired by a similar machanic featured in Brawl- a mod for SSBB.
Much thanks to the SSBU modding Discord and everyone who took the time to answer all my annoying questions.

v1.0 Change Log:

    Side-Special no longer puts Ike into Special-Fall if he misses.
    Normal Counter no longer has blue flame effects.
    Neutral-Special is chargable (like Samus).
    Neutral-Special can be jump/shield canceled.
    If a max charge is stored:
    -all of Ike's sword attacks have a blue sword trail and flame effects
    -all of Ike's sword attacks deal 1.2x more damage
    -all of Ike's sword attacks do aura type damage (like Lucario)
    -all of Ike's sword attacks incur recoil damage (like Pichu)
    -Up-Special's landing hit has an added explosion effect with matching hit-box
